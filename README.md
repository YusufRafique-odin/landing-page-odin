# landing-page-odin
Pre-project update:

This project will follow TOP's landing page assignment structure as closely as i can.
My goal is to try and incorporate all of the concepts i learned during the course.


Post-project update:

This assignment took me 2 days to complete. The website has an elephant theme because elephants are fun.
I tried to use flexbox for most of the page's structure. I learnt a lot during this assignment and doing this
definitely helped me make some concepts 'click' in my mind. I would rate myself on this as 8/10. My css is a little 
messy though, that needs some improvement...
